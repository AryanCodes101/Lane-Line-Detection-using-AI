# Lane-Line-Detection
I developed a project to detect road lane lines in video using AI. Steps include Gaussian smoothing for noise reduction, grayscale conversion for simplicity, Canny edge detection for edge highlighting, region masking to focus on lanes, and Hough transformation to detect lines. This aids in autonomous driving and driver assistance systems.
