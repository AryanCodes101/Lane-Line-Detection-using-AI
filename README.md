# Lane Line Detection using artificial intelligence ðŸ›£ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

This project implements a lane line detection system using computer vision techniques and AI algorithms. The system processes video input to identify and highlight lane lines, essential for various applications in autonomous driving, lane departure warning systems, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

## Overview

The lane line detection pipeline comprises several essential steps:

1. **Gaussian Smoothing**: Applies Gaussian blur to the input image to reduce noise and detail, facilitating more accurate edge detection in subsequent steps.

2. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the input image into a grayscale representation, simplifying further processing and reducing computational complexity.

3. **Canny Edge Detection**: Utilizes the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify significant changes in pixel intensity, effectively detecting edges, including lane lines, in the image.

4. **Region Masking**: Masks out irrelevant parts of the image, focusing the lane detection process on the region of interest (typically the lower half of the image), where lane lines are expected to appear.

5. **Hough Transformation**: Detects lines in the masked image space using the Hough transform, converting them from Cartesian to Hough parameter space. This step effectively identifies straight lines, potentially representing lane lines.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, preferably using a virtual environment.
3. Run the main script to process a video file or live camera feed.
4. View the output video with lane lines highlighted.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:
